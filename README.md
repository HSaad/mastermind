# Mastermind

A command line version of mastermind. To play a player must guess their opponent's secret code within a certain number of turns. Each turn, some feedback is provided concerning how good the guess was (whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space). 

To play, 'cd' into the folder using the command line and run the mastermind.rb file. 

	$ruby tic_tac_toe.rb
